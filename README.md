### Project Wireframe 

This website will have two designs. One for mobile and one for desktops. I have attached two pictures/wireframes of how they should look. 
I have also attached a page flow. 
The page flow consists of six components:
Post,
New,
Hot,
Top,
Search,
comments

These first four components will show posts related to their topics. For example, if you click on "New" it will show you a list of new posts on the forum.
The Post component will be somewhat interactive with the "Comments" button. If you click on the comments section it should have a dropdown of all the comments that have been made on that post. 

The "Search" section will allow you to search any topic on the reddit page. This will be done using the reddit API.
